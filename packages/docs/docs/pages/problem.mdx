# Problem: Predictable Onchain Expenditures

Onchain resources (e.g. gas, blobspace) are subject to unstable supply/demand dynamics. 

While volatile costs can reasonably be passed through to sophisticated onchain power users, most consumer-grade applications will abstract these costs away from end-users and consolidate them through paymasters (operated on behalf of layer 2 sequencers, RaaS providers, account abstraction services, centralized exchanges, etc.). 

These businesses will naturally prefer to stabilize costs where possible to enable fixed cost pricing models for clients.
