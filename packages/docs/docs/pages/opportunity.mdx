# Opportunity: Everything Onchain

The gas economy is by far the largest cryptonative market today.

The suite of onchain resources available to builders is in a state of rapid expansion (blobspace markets on Ethereum, Celestia, EigenDA, etc., Solana, other L1 blockspace). 

While sporadic usage trends have tended to dominate in the past, commercial entities with more industrial consumption trends are accounting for an increasingly large share of onchain activity and a secular trend towards further demand aggregation is expected to continue into the future.
